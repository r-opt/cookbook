During initial package development it acts as early documentation and also a big integration test to guide further development. It currently is assumed you already know a bit about the theory of mixed integer programming (I will write something about it at a later point in time). Each chapter is a broad problem category (like Scheduling or Puzzles) and contains a set of problems that help you get started. In order to run the examples in this book, you need the rmpk package together with a solver. options(repos = c( ropt = &quot;https://r-opt.r-universe.dev&quot;, CRAN = &quot;https://cloud.r-project.org&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;rmpk&quot;) # modelling install.packages(&quot;ROIoptimzer&quot;) # ROI optimizer install.packages(&quot;ROI.plugin.glpk&quot;) # Bindings to GLPK Please note however that this book is work in progress.
